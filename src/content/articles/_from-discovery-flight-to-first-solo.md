The end of the year might feel like a time to slow down, but for future pilots, it can be one of the most productive periods to begin flight training. Many students at **Alto Flight Academy** take their first steps in late November and December, and quickly build momentum going into the new year.

If you're considering flight training, here is how far you can go before December wraps up.

## Start With a Discovery Flight

Your journey begins with a Discovery Flight, where you’ll:

- Meet an instructor  
- Learn the basics of aircraft controls  
- Fly the airplane with hands-on guidance  
- See Oklahoma City from an unforgettable new perspective  

This one flight often gives students the confidence and motivation to begin formal training right away.

## What You Can Learn in Your First Few Lessons

With winter’s cool, dense air and calmer days, December is a great time to learn fundamentals such as:

- Straight-and-level flight  
- Climbs, descents, and turns  
- Using the radios and communicating in the pattern  
- Preflight procedures and checklists  
- Flying the traffic pattern at KCPS  

Shorter daylight hours also allow for **night flight exposure earlier in training**, a unique advantage many students love.

## Building Toward Your First Solo

With consistent training, 2 to 3 lessons per week, many students reach major early milestones quickly. Before solo, you’ll develop:

- Confident takeoffs and smooth landings  
- Pattern awareness and spacing  
- Safe decision-making  
- Control coordination and trim usage  
- Comfortable radio communication  

Many students who start before the end of the year are ready for their solo flight early in the spring.

## Begin Now, Launch Strong in 2026

Starting your training now means entering the new year with real progress already made. Instead of waiting until January, you can:

- Complete early-stage training  
- Build strong fundamentals  
- Gain weather and seasonal flying experience  
- Move toward checkride readiness faster
