If you've ever dreamed of flying but weren’t sure where to start, a **discovery flight** is the perfect first step. At Alto Flight Academy, it’s more than just a ride—it’s a hands-on introduction to the world of aviation. Whether you're thinking about becoming a pilot or just curious about what it's like to fly, here's what you can expect from your very first flight.

## Before the Flight: Meet Your Instructor and Get a Tour

When you arrive at **Sundance Airport (KHSD)**, you’ll be greeted by a certified flight instructor who will walk you through what to expect. You'll get a quick tour of the aircraft and the flight school facilities. This is your chance to ask any questions you may have about becoming a pilot or how training works.

## Pre-Flight Briefing: Safety First

Before taking off, your instructor will explain the basics of flight and go over a **pre-flight checklist**. You’ll learn what the instruments do, how the flight controls work, and what each step of the process involves. Don’t worry—you don’t need any previous knowledge. Everything is explained in simple terms.

## Time to Fly: You Take the Controls

Once you're buckled in and the engine starts, you'll taxi to the runway with your instructor guiding you every step of the way. After takeoff, you’ll get a chance to **take the controls** and fly the plane yourself—yes, even on your first day! With the instructor right next to you, you’ll steer, climb, and turn the aircraft while enjoying stunning views of the Oklahoma landscape.

## The View from Above: See Your World from a New Angle

Most discovery flights last around 30–60 minutes. During your flight, you’ll likely see landmarks like the **Oklahoma River**, **Downtown OKC**, or the **surrounding countryside**. It’s a beautiful way to experience flight for the first time, and many students say it’s what made them fall in love with aviation.

## After Landing: Debrief and Next Steps

Once you’re back on the ground, your instructor will answer any questions and explain how flight training works if you decide to continue. You’ll leave with a logbook entry for your very first flight—an exciting first step toward becoming a pilot!
