    intro:
      "When you studied for your private pilot certificate, you learned about the difference between IMC and VMC conditions.  VMC, visual meterological conditions, is weather where you as a pilot flies visually with reference to the ground.  IMC on the other hand means instrument meterological conditions which is weather where you cannot fly visually and in reference to the ground and must rely solely on the flight instruments to fly safely.  Earning your instrument rating makes you a safer more proficient pilot that can safely navigate within the US National Airspace System in IMC conditions.",
