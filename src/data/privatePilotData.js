      "If you're just starting out and learning how to fly, this is where you'll be.  The private pilot certificate, also infamously known as a 'pilot license' is the first certification you will receive in your pilot training journey.  You'll learn the fundamentals of flight: straight and level flight, turns, climbs, and descents. You'll also learn what all those gauges and screens mean.  Soon enough you'll know the difference between an attitude indicator and a directional gyro.  If all of that looks fun to you, we encourage you to reach out to us and schedule an introductory discovery flight.  It'll be your first flight lesson where you take controls of an airplane.",

During flight training, you'll learn to apply the knowledge learned during ground school.  You'll be paired up with a certified flight instructor.  Together you'll come up with a plan tailored to your learning needs and schedule and complete the necessary requirements to become a private pilot.  The first step is giving us a call or filling out one of our forms to get in contact with an Alto Flight Academy team member.  Give us a call today and let's get you in the air and started!",
