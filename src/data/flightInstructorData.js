      "For many pilots aiming for an airline career or other aviation paths, spending a few years instructing is a common way to gain experience and accumulate flight hours. Some find a passion for flight instructing and choose to make it a long term career. While being a CFI is the most typical route for commercial pilots to meet ATP minimums, it isnâ€™t the right path for everyone. CFIs play a crucial role in shaping the future of aspiring pilots, and a lack of passion for aviation and teaching can negatively impact their training experience.",
