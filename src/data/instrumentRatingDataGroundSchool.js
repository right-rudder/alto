    intro:
      "If you are a private pilot, getting your instrument is the next part of your aviation journey.  Obtaining your instrument rating allows you to fly in IMC - instrument meterological conditions.  To fly safely in IMC weather, you're going to need to become familiar with how the aircraft systems work and how ATC (air traffic control) can help keep you safe when you're unable to fly visually.  Flying safely in IMC weather means flying procedurally.  You'll need to be able to read and interpret approach plates and charts to help you navigate safely. Additionally, although having an instrument rating allows you to fly in less favorable weather, you'll need to understand the limitations that are there and the safe guards that are in place to keep you flying the next day as well.  Enrolling in our instrument ground school is your chance to meet with a CFII and other pilots who are in similar stages of pilot training.  Give us a call today and stop by Alto Flight Academy for more information.",
