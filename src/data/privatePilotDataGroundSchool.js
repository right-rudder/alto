Flying isn't just about understanding the hand, feet, and eye coordination of the controls in the cockpit.  You'll need to understand how the airplane flies, the atmosphere in which it flies, and the regulations put in place to keep us flying safely in the air.  Through understanding aerodynamics, weather, regulations, and aircraft systems you'll be able to safely navigate the skies and become a pilot.
