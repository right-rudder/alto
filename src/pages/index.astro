        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pt-10 text-gray-200 text-left px-5 lg:px-40">
          I started flight training in May 2002 in 4891J at PWA. Cliff Shaw was my flight instructor, but he was also a friend of mine from our Naval Squadron at Tinker AFB. Hal Harris was the owner of the planes, and at the time they were kept over at the Service Center by the south end of the field at PWA.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pt-10 text-gray-200 text-left px-5 lg:px-40">
          Since Cliff and I were both active duty, we were gone quite a bit so I couldn’t train as often as I would’ve liked, but I soloed in 67797 at Sundance on Feb 19, 2003. I’ve been flying ever since, primarily as a hobby, and I’ve been in several flying clubs. I’ve flown my family and friends all around the Midwest. I’ve had several different careers along the way, but I became a CFI in April 2022, and got hired by Airshare in April of this year (2023). 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pt-10 text-gray-200 text-left px-5 lg:px-40">
          I’m an SIC on the Phenom 300, and recently got the opportunity to fly some clients to Sundance. I couldn’t believe it when I spotted both 67797 and 4891J on the ramp. I had to get my picture with each plane! It was quite the experience for me being able to reflect on my first solo, which seems like so long ago. It’s been my dream to fly corporate aircraft, but I’ll never forget where I started!
